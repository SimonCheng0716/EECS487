# EECS487: Exploring Gender Bias in LLM-Generated Job Descriptions

This project investigates potential gender biases in job descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs). By analyzing outputs from various LLMs, the study aims to understand how different prompt designs influence gender associations in generated content.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Data/**:Contains `Occupation Data.xlsx` with 1,016 real-world job titles sourced from the O*NET database

- **Prompt/**:
  - `generate_prompts.py`:Script to generate prompts for all models and styles
  - `Vicuna/`, `Mistral_7B/`, `Llama2_7B/`:Directories containing prompts tailored for each respective model

- **Evaluation/**:
  - `gender_evaluation.py`:Script utilizing GPT-4o-mini for gender inference on generated descriptions

- **README.md**:Provides an overview and instructions for using the project

## 🧪 Prompt Variants
The project employs four prompt variants to generate job description:

| Prompt Type    | Includes Job Title | Gender-Neutral |
|----------------|--------------------|----------------|
| `title_zero`   | ✅                 | ❌             |
| `title_one`    | ✅                 | ✅             |
| `wo_title_zero`| ❌                 | ❌             |
| `wo_title_one` | ❌                 | ✅             |
Each variant is designed to assess the impact of prompt structure on the gender associations in the generated conten.

## 📊 Evaluation Methodology

- **Assessment Tool*: GPT-4o-mini is used to infer the perceived gender from each generated job descriptin.

- **Metrics*: The analysis focuses on the distribution of gender associations (male, female, both) across different models and prompt typs.

## 📈 Visualization & Resuls

The project includes scripts to generate visualizations and tables that illustrate the gender distribution in the generated job descriptin. These outputs help in identifying patterns and biases present in the LLMs' outpts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SimonCheng0716/EECS487.git
